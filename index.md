My name is Iyswarya Narayanan. I'm a Performance and Capacity Engineer at Facebook in CEA Resource Foundation team. I graduated with a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from Penn State in 2019. My PhD advisor is [Prof. Anand Sivasubramaniam](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~axs53/). I'm broadly interested in datacenter scale computing with a focus on capacity provisioning, power/energy management, storage systems and data analytics.
